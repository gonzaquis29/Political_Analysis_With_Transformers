  warnings.warn(
Some weights of BertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at dccuchile/bert-base-spanish-wwm-uncased and are newly initialized: ['bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
