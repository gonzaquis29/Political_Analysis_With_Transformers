Any affirmative action should be based on socio-economic conditions rather than race to ensure it is truly fair and inclusive.",0,-1
67,"I firmly believe in the concept of equal household responsibilities, where traditional gender roles should not determine who does what in the family setup. Both men and women should engage in various chores, including childcare, allowing every family member to develop a wide range of skills. This promotes a balanced and harmonious family structure, fostering equal partnerships between spouses.",0,1
68,"I firmly believe that equal access to healthcare is a fundamental right, not a privilege.

305,"I believe in the importance of upholding our nation's laws and ensuring the security of our borders. While I understand the need for compassionate immigration policy, I think it is equally crucial to have a just and fair system that prioritizes legal immigration.

Regarding the issue of welfare, it's my belief that a system encouraging self-reliance and hard work, rather than dependency, will not only help individuals but also our nation as a whole to thrive. However, it's crucial to ensure a safety net for those truly in need.",0,-1

It is crucial that the United States re-evaluate its support of the Saudi-led coalition that is exacerbating an already dire situation. Our foreign policy should be centered around promoting peace and protecting human rights, rather than perpetuating violence and conflict.",1,0
310,"Addressing the issue of global trade, I believe in the necessity of securing our national interests. A nation must prioritize its own economic growth and stability, which often involves striking strategic trade deals and protecting domestic industries. Unrestricted foreign competition can often adversely impact our local businesses and workforce, hence, a balanced approach is required.",-1,0
311,"The current global climate crisis, in my opinion, necessitates swift and sweeping changes in our approach to energy production and consumption.

Market forces alone cannot be relied upon to solve this issue; government intervention and international cooperation will be crucial in effecting this necessary change.",1,0
312,"While I fully acknowledge the importance of fiscal responsibility, I firmly believe that we must also prioritize social programs that support our most vulnerable citizens.

313,"While I understand the desire to help those in need, it's essential to consider the economic implications of continued government assistance programs.

This is not a denial of their humanity, but a reaffirmation that America, as a sovereign nation, has the right to maintain its borders and ensure security for its citizens.",0,-1
317,"The issue of energy independence remains crucial in maintaining a nation's sovereignty and economic stability.
