"While I fundamentally believe in the importance of environmental stewardship, I also value the principles of limited government intervention, individual liberty, and free market capitalism to drive innovation and technological advances.

Instead, I advocate for market-based solutions and public-private partnerships to help mitigate environmental concerns while still promoting economic growth.",0,1,2103
"I believe in the importance of religious freedom, as it is a fundamental human right to practice one's faith without fear of persecution or discrimination.

"It's clear that our healthcare system needs to be reformed to ensure that all citizens have access to affordable, quality care. The fact that millions of Americans are uninsured or underinsured is not only a moral failing, but it also undermines our economy and public health. We must explore options like universal healthcare and expanded Medicaid to remedy this situation.",1,4,2262
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of traditional family values that have been the cornerstone of our society for centuries.

"It's evident that the country's economic health is enormously reliant on the efforts of small businesses, and entrepreneurial growth must be fostered to secure our future.

"The handling of the Iran Nuclear Deal was deeply flawed from the onset. It provided a temporary freeze on the nuclear program, but it did not fully address the long-term implications of a nuclear Iran, failing to tackle issues like Iran's ballistic missile program or its destabilizing activities in the Middle East.

Providing a living wage and strengthening social programs are key steps in ensuring a fairer distribution of wealth.",1,0,1840
"It is my steadfast belief that the traditional family structure, comprising of a mother and a father, provides the most favorable environment for the holistic development of children.

Furthermore, corporations and the wealthy should pay their fair share of taxes to support essential public services and infrastructure which benefits all of society.",1,0,239
"It's particularly disconcerting to see the lack of action towards the egregious human rights violations occurring in regions like Xinjiang, China.

This can be achieved through progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and substantial investments in education and healthcare. Moreover, addressing income inequality should be a priority to ensure a fair distribution of wealth.",1,0,231
"Ensuring a fair income for all workers should be a top priority for our economic system, considering the skyrocketing costs of living.
